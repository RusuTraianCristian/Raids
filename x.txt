1st problem
non partners and non affiliates (non bits receivers) can see, install, configure, activate and use the extension
leads to bugs people can't send them bits since their channel cant receive
solution add filter to prevent from configuring and activating and using non partners and non affiliates

2nd problem
people can activate and use without configuring or properly configuring on purpose or by forgeting
this can lead to bugs
enforce configuring on config page, check settings if correct, only then allow activation and usage. liveconfig should bypass filter of 1st problem and 2nd filter
because it has been activated so by default, settings were correct

3rd problem
people don't understand what's what. input fields such as bits required and raid target channel should CLEARLY and concisely be specified and not mistaken
should be easy to understand and stupid simple

4th prob
add live bits currently raised on config to see changes on reset

5th
when marketing, specify it's a partner/affiliate only extension since it requires bits. this should prevent useless installations and server usage
and should also lower the amount of unnecessary analytics data for extension



when accessing config, before displaying and allowing config, check for affiliate or partner
add checker only to config without adding to liveconfig because LiveConfig wont display since its not activated
if neither, display message that you can't use it yet
else, if aff or partner, display 1 time overlay guide and then allow config. if no config is done after install, don't allow activation
third problem: mention that "target" is the target channel for raid, not target in bits and not full url.
market it and specify for those that are partners or affiliates!!!
